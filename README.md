## Word-Sense-Disambiguation

This repository contains the implementation of four baseline models for Word Sense Disambiguation, including Lesk, Naive Bayes, K-Nearest Neighbors, and BiLSTM. Additionally, a BERT-based model has been included for comparison. The models have been trained on the SemCor dataset and evaluated on the Senseval and SemEval datasets.
